    "\n",
    "This project uses dynamite to explore many-body localization (MBL), a surprising phenomenon in which certain many-body systems with sufficiently strong disorder fail to thermalize. In particular we will study the *MBL transition*, in which the system moves from thermalizing to localized as the disorder strength is increased. Characterization of this transition has remained elusive: finite size effects seem hard to avoid, and tensor network methods break down due to extensive entanglement in states near the transition. Thus, iterative methods like the Krylov subspace methods used by dynamite have proved to be one of the best tools for its study.[<sup>1</sup>](#ref1) We refer readers interested in learning more about the physics of MBL to one of the excellent review papers on the subject.[<sup>2</sup>](#ref2)\n",

    "In this project we plot two quantities that help us identify the MBL transition: the half-chain entanglement entropy of eigenstates, and an eigenvalue statistic called the *adjacent gap ratio*. The half chain entanglement entropy $S_{L/2}$ is simply the bipartite von Neumann entropy when half the spins are traced out. The MBL transition should correspond to a transition from volume law to area law entanglement. The adjacent gap ratio computes a measure of how likely eigenvalues are to be near each other. Let $\\Delta_i$ be the gap between the $i^\\mathrm{th}$ eigenvalue and the following one; that is, $\\Delta_i = \\lambda_{i+1} - \\lambda_i$. Then, the adjacent gap ratio is defined as $r_i = \\frac{\\min \\left( \\Delta_i, \\Delta_{i+1} \\right)}{\\max \\left( \\Delta_i, \\Delta_{i+1} \\right)}$. Random matrix theory tells us that in the thermal phase, the expectation value of $r$ should be $\\left< r \\right> \\approx 0.53$, while in the localized phase $\\left< r \\right> \\approx 0.39$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key feature that makes MBL so interesting is that the transition from volume to area law entanglement does not only occur in the ground state, but in excited states as well. This presents a great use case for dynamite's `target` eigenvalue solver, which finds the $k$ eigenvalues (and eigenvectors) closest to a target energy, where $k$ is user configurable. So, the plan is as follows: we will choose a few energies at various points in the spectrum, solve for some reasonable number (say, 32) eigenpairs near each of those points, and then compute the entanglement entropy and adjacent gap ratio for all of those eigenpairs."

    "## Remark: details of the solver for excited states\n",
    "\n",
    "The iterative solver used by dynamite to solve for eigenpairs is very good at finding *extremal* eigenvalues---those with the largest absolute value. To apply this solver to finding sets of interior eigenvalues, dynamite uses what's called the *shift-invert* transformation. Instead of applying the solver to the Hamiltonian $H$ itself, it is applied to the transformed Hamiltonian $(H-E_\\mathrm{targ})^{-1}$, where $E_\\mathrm{targ}$ is the target energy near which eigenpairs are desired. With this transformation, the eigenvalues closest to $E_\\mathrm{targ}$ become extremal.\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply the iterative solver, we need to be able to efficiently compute matrix vector products of the form $(H-E_\\mathrm{targ})^{-1} \\vec{x}$. To implement this, PETSc (the linear algebra library that underlies dynamite) computes the LU factorization of $H$---a pair of matrices $L$ and $U$ where $L$ is lower triangular and $U$ is upper triangular, and $H = LU$. This factorization makes it very easy to perform the linear solves needed to apply the matrix inverse, but it comes with multiple costs. For one, the $LU$ factorization generally requires significantly more memory to store than $H$ itself. Furthermore, computing the $LU$ factorization can be computationally expensive.\n",

    "Thus, you will find solving for interior eigenvalues to be much more computationally intensive than solving for ground states."

    "(also discussed in the SYK example)\n",
    "\n",
    "The MBL Hamiltonian is a case in which getting good data requires disorder averaging---that is, running the computation many times with fresh randomness. Given $N$ CPU cores there are two main ways one can parallelize that process: (1) running $N$ disorder realizations independently at the same time, each using one core, and (2) using MPI to parallelize one computation across all $N$ cores and then doing each disorder realization in sequence. In this case, (1) will almost always be faster and should be prioritized---while the MPI parallelism in dynamite is highly optimized, there will always be some cost to the communication between cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are situations in which using MPI may be preferable, for example if running $N$ independent disorder realizations uses too much memory. Ultimately, the user should experiment with different configurations to determine what gives the best performance. Unfortunately, PETSc currently only supports performing part of the shift-invert computation on GPUs, so for this computation GPU performance is bottlenecked (hopefully this will change soon)."

    "One needs to take extra care when using randomness in code that will be run under MPI with multiple ranks. Each rank is its own Python process, and by default will have a different random seed---so if you are not careful, each of your ranks may end up trying to build a different Hamiltonian! (dynamite does check that the Hamiltonian is the same on all ranks before building the underlying matrix, so you will get an error if this happens).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to handle this: one is to have rank 0 pick a random seed and use MPI to communicate it to all the other ranks, and the other is to simply pass a seed on the command line. Both are implemented in this example for demonstration purposes: if no seed is passed on the command line, then one is generated and communicated to all MPI ranks. If you pass a random seed on the command line, make sure to change it each time you run the code if you want new disorder realizations!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 1:** when setting a random state via `State(state='random')`, dynamite is already careful about coordinating randomness between MPI ranks, so the user does not need to worry about it in that case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 2:** If you will never run your code on multiple MPI ranks, you don't need to worry about this at all. In particular, running on a GPU with 1 CPU process will not encounter this issue."
