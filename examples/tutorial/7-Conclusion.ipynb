    "You have completed a tour of dynamite's features! Hopefully you will find it useful. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few final things to explore:\n",
    "\n",
    " - While notebooks are a good sandbox for exploring, for serious computations dynamite is best used in a standalone Python script. This allows, for example, easy parallelization on clusters via MPI.\n",
    " - Speaking of clusters, dynamite is super easy to run, no setup required, on a cluster with Singularity (or another containerization application) installed. On a compute node, you can simply run the following:\n",
    "   - `singularity exec docker://gdmeyer/dynamite python your_script.py`\n",
    " - dynamite also supports GPU computations! Using the `gdmeyer/dynamite:latest-cuda` container, on a compute node with a GPU you can run\n",
    "   - `singularity exec --nv docker://gdmeyer/dynamite:latest-cuda python your_script.py`\n",
    "   - You may find it best to enable shell matrices, due to the limited RAM of most GPUs\n",
    " - For more information about running dynamite on clusters with Singularity, see [the documentation](https://dynamite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/containers.html#singularity-usage).\n",
    " \n",
    "As a reminder, dynamite's documentation is at [dynamite.readthedocs.io](https://dynamite.readthedocs.io/)."
